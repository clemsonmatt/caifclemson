            <h4>What Folks are Saying About CAIF</h4>
            <hr />
            <ul style="list-style:none;">
                <li>"Being a international student in U.S. is not the most exciting thing if you have been through all this: homesick, lonely, helpless. But having a host family here changed everything. You have people who treat you as family, who help and care about you. The warmth you get from family can support you to keep going and smiling at life".

                <li>"I am so fortunate that I could meet such a lovely family. I want to show my gratitude to my host family from the bottom of my heart. I couldn't adjust to life in Clemson so fast and so well without their help. I am deeply thankful for that they open their house and their heart to me, and for their patience and care. I never feel afraid to make changes because they accept what I like. I work hard without fear because I know I always have a home to go to and have a family to stay with. I love my host family so much. Thanks for CAIF host the welcome event."

                <br />
                <li> "Serving as a CAIF host family has been so much fun! We started with what we thought were 4 students, but later learned that one was married and had a 5 year old son. Then when a couple of them couldn't make it to our house for a cookout because they couldn't drive, they talked a friend into bringing them and soon we had another! Never had a large family until we "adopted" international students--it has been a tremendous blessing getting to know them and helping them integrate into the American culture."

                <br />
                <li>"Been almost 7.5 years & still remember the day when I was at CAIF welcome event. Two happy, little girls with their happy mom & dad came up & invited me over dinner. I went with hopes of friendship and stepped out of their door as a part of their family. Simply put "I gained a home away from home & priceless love meant to last forever".

                <li>"I am truly blessed to have (my host family) by my side when I am so far away from my family.  So proud to have an American Mom & Dad in my life!  Love you both.  God bless!"

                <br />
                <li> "My family has been 'adopting' students for 10+ years. Over 30 delightful college students have graced our home throughout the years, representing the countries of India, China, Iran, Germany, El Salvador, and Japan. We have shared many laughs, meaningful conversations about a variety of topics, and LOTS of good food. It has been our great joy to celebrate many graduations, birthdays, achievements, marriages, birth of new babies, etc. with our international friends. We also count it a privilege to have been 'mom and dad' during some very difficult times in the lives of our students. My husband and I try to treat these young people the way we hope some kind family would treat our daughters if they were in another country."
